The way our CSP is coded, one will have to get the domain and constraints
by checking if a string is a key of a dict. So we put the part that changes
from a variable to the next first, in order to check more quickly

Switching constraint to set to be able to handle intersections more cleanly

Do we need to actually store the tuples for the constraint ? Should we reduce domain once constraints are generated ? If size
of a constraint is far of domain_1 * domain_2 we should be able to cut.
Should we first build the lambdas and only at the end create the tuples and cut the
domains ?

We need to switch constraints to function only, if there is a need to have a tuple, one can always check if (a,b) in []
as a function.

For the optimization problem, we stay in decision but do a dichotomy on the values.

Switching Domains to a list of domain and constraint to a dict with keys on indices.

Mixing AC3 and forward will not be trivial implementation-wise.
Managed a factor 2 gain

AC3 helps reducing the number of nodes, but it takes a lot of time right now
